    <h3>how to make cookies</h3>
    <p>Chef John's Chocolate Chip Cookies</p> 
     <p>Crispy around the edges, chewy and chocolaty in the middle, and thin, oh so</P>
    <p>thin. My 'secret' formula has been adapted from Alton Brown's famous, 'The</p>
    <p>Thin' recipe, and is fairly foolproof. The only real variable is the baking time,</p>
    <p>since we all scoop slightly different amounts. And yes, of course you can add</p>
    <p>nuts to yours!</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4> 
     <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, very soft</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
        <li>1 ¼ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
      </ul>
   <h4>Steps to take</h4>
   <ol>
    <li><p>Whisk flour, salt, and baking soda together in a bowl. In a separate bowl, cream</p>
        <P>the butter, white sugar, and brown sugar together until mixture is light and</P>
        <p>fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the egg, milk, and vanilla extract. Whisk liquids</p>
        <p>together in small areas around the bowl, then all together to avoid separation.</p></li>
    <li><p>Pour dry ingredients into the wet ingredients; stir until flour is thoroughly mixed</p>
        <p>in. Stir in the chocolate chips.</p></li>
    <li><p>Transfer dough to a resealable plastic bag. Refrigerate until dough is firm, at</p>
        <p>least 2 hours.</p></li>
    <li><p>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line baking sheet with parchment paper.</p></li>
    <li><p>Scoop out rounded tablespoons of dough and place on prepared baking sheet,</p>
        <p>leaving 4 inches of space between cookies (about 8 per sheet). Bake in</p>
        <p>preheated oven until cookies are golden brown, about 12 minutes. Slide</p>
        <p>parchment and cookies onto a cooling rack for a few minutes. Remove</p>
        <p>parchment and finish cooling the cookies on the rack.</p></li>
